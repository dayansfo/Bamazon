Bamazon Store App
Is an online store app similar to Amazon. Customers can view and purchase the products available in the database (if they're in stock).

If a requested product does not have the requisite inventory, they will be notified of how many units are in stock, and given the option to continue the purchasing process for a different amount of units.
